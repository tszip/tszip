*TypeScript to ES Module compiler.*

Use tszip to compile TypeScript libraries, including React components, written
in ESNext to 100% tree-shakeable ES module packages (*not* bundles). Please see
the [**Usage**](#Usage) section for an overview of how this works.

The [legacy fork](https://npmjs.com/package/@tszip/legacy), which aimed to
guarantee backwards compatibility if that is your goal, is now deprecated
(before ever having been released). If you need CJS interop at the library level
out-of-the-box, please use that package.

## Quick Start

Install tszip and create a new package:

```bash
# install tszip globally
yarn global add @tszip/tszip

# create a package
tszip create $PACKAGE_NAME
```

Enter the workspace and start developing, or build the release package:

```bash
# listen for changes
tszip dev

# -or-

# build release
tszip build
```

## Usage

This tool is used to compile TS and JS libraries, i.e. it bundles modules and
exposes them for import by others downstream.

### ESNext input

tszip projects are able to use the full range of features offered by ESNext,
including top-level `await` and ES module syntax, which are left in the emitted
output.¹

<!--
### Importing CJS

You can treat CJS modules as ES modules without thinking. Named, default, and
star imports will all work as expected.

Under the hood, all `import` and `require` statements will be transpiled to
dynamic `const ... = await import(...)` assignments. This comes at the minor
trade-off of all imports occurring sequentially:  These could be transpiled to
`Promise.all(...)` blocks in the future to prevent this, but for now there is
more utility in seamless ESM-CJS interop.
-->


### Importing CJS

You can use `require()` statements to require CJS modules if necessary:

```js
const { namedImport } = require("my-cjs-module")
```

It will eventually be possible to treat CJS modules like ESM like so, as they
will be compiled to `await import()` statements:

```js
import { namedImport } from "my-cjs-module"
```


However, this is currently delayed by [Next.js's late support for top-level
await](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/31054#issue-1046210941) which
prevents valid ESM programs from being consumed by Next.

### Internal vs. external entry points

*Note: This behavior can be disabled by editing the `exports` field in your
project's package.json.*

tszip projects leverage the package.json `exports` field to automatically
resolve subpath imports for your package, which mimics something like an
optimized version of legacy `require()` logic.
  
  - An import from `your-package/submodule` is an import from
    `your-package/submodule/index.js`. 

  - Non-`index` endpoints are "internal" to the package and cannot be imported
    directly without being re-exported at an `index` file.

**In short, only `index` files are available for import downstream**.³ For more
detail, consider the following typical project structure:

```none
src
├── a
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── utils.ts
├── b
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── utils.ts
├── c
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── subpath
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── utils.ts
├── constants.ts
├── index.ts
└── utils.ts
```

Output in `dist/` takes the following form and maps to the following import
specifiers (type declarations and sourcemaps omitted):

```none
dist
├── a
│   ├── index.js      ➞  your-package/a
│   └── utils.js
├── b
│   ├── index.js      ➞  your-package/b
│   └── utils.js
├── c
│   ├── index.js      ➞  your-package/c
│   ├── subpath
│   │   └── index.js  ➞  your-package/c/subpath
│   └── utils.js
├── constants.js
├── index.js          ➞  your-package
└── utils.js
```

The main result is that `index` modules (`your-package/a`, `your-package/b`,
etc.) are said to be **external** in that you can import them from another ES
module, and non-`index` modules (`constants.js`, `utils.js`, `a/utils.js`, etc.)
are **internal** in that they are emitted as output, but cannot be imported
without re-exporting at an `index`.

See the following examples, where `your-package` is the name of the package in
package.json:

```ts
/** This is a downstream module importing your package. */

// your-package is always exported as the root index
import { whatever } from 'your-package'

// your-package/a is an index file, and is exported
import { whatever } from 'your-package/a'

// error! this entry point is not an index, and is not exported
import { whatever } from 'your-package/a/utils'
```

Additional examples are available under [**Footnotes** > More examples regarding
subdir import specifiers](#more-examples-regarding-subdir-import-specifiers).

## Commands

### `yarn boot`

This is an escape hatch to build an executable (but unoptimized) version of your
project without using tszip involved (only TSC and Rollup). Can be used for
debugging if there are errors in the output emitted by `tszip build`.

### `yarn dev`

Runs the project in development/watch mode, automatically compiling and
refreshing on changes.

### `yarn build`

Runs the release build process and compiles optimized output to `dist/`.

### `yarn test`

Runs your tests using Jest.

### `yarn lint`

Runs Eslint with Prettier on .ts and .tsx files. If you want to customize eslint
you can add an `eslint` block to your package.json, or you can run `yarn lint
--write-file` and edit the generated `.eslintrc` file.

## Customization
### Jest

You can add your own `jest.config.js` to the root of your project and tszip
will **shallow merge** it with [its own Jest config](./src/createJestConfig.ts).

### ESLint

You can add your own `.eslintrc` to the root of your project and tszip will
**deep merge** it with [its own ESLint config](./src/createEslintConfig.ts).

## Inspiration

tszip is an iteration on [TSDX](https://github.com/formium/tsdx), which was
originally ripped out of [Formik's](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik) build
tooling. See [@developit/microbundle](https://github.com/developit/microbundle)
for related work.

## Footnotes

¹ Because of multiple competing standards, consumers of packages may need to
transpile code to older featuresets (i.e. pre-ES2015) in order for them to work
in certain contexts. However, there is no need for this to be done upstream, as
is currently done now, but only before bundling for the client (and even then,
only if needed).

Developers should be able to specify modules in ESNext to take full advantage of
new syntax and ES module resolution benefits, which is what tszip aims to
enable. At the upstream library level, we can ship code without polyfills, using
the latest syntax and module resolution, and leave it up to the consumer to
transpile it down if necessary as part of their build pipeline.

With this approach, newer contexts that support newer features can take direct
advantage of them by default rather than being locked into a legacy system, e.g.
by being forced to consume polyfilled library code or an ESM wrapper around
legacy CJS modules.

² This works identically to legacy behavior only because each entry point is
mapped to a transpiled version of itself. Default Rollup behavior of compiling
all code to a single output bundle would break this assumption and make shimming
`require` impossible.

*Note (9/7/2021): `require` is now shimmed only for the Rollup process, rather
than once per-file, but this documentation may be needed in the future in case
this logic is re-implemented.*

³ This logic is an efficient compromise given the way Node.js resolves the
`exports` field: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/39994

See the Node.js docs for more info about conditional exports:
https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_subpath_patterns

### More examples regarding subdir import specifiers

tszip will build this same structure in `src/` to `dist/` when building the
package.  As explained above, the exports configuration provides for the
following behavior:

  - Module specifiers, such as:
      1. `your-package`
      2. `your-package/a`
      3. `your-package/b`
      4. `your-package/c/subpath`, etc.

    Are resolved to `index` files:
      1. `your-package/index.js`
      2. `your-package/a/index.js`
      3. `your-package/b/index.js`,
      4. `your-package/c/subpath/index.js`, etc.

  - Whereas non-`index` files:
      - `your-package/constants.js`
      - `your-package/a/utils.js`
      - `your-package/b/utils.js`, etc.

    cannot be imported without being re-exporting at an index (e.g. `export *
    from './utils'` in `index.ts`).
